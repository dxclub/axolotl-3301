<!-- Dx Club Meeting,  April 7th, 2021.
    The code found in this project was created for the 
    routine coding challenge that takes place at the beginning of every Dx Club meeting. This week, the responibility of creating an event landed on the Dx Club Programming team, so we creaetd a moderately difficult decoding challenge.

    For this meeting, we decided to focus on the coding/programming prowess of the Dx Club members, and the event focuses on an Elite Group of hackers looking to recruit more members. They recently lost a couple of hackers due to incompentency so they have made sure to be really careful in creating their codes to recruit more members. Hopefully the Dx Club can step in and fix this problem!

    The code was worked on by Laura C., Diego G., and Salvador G. over the course of 2
    days. We have tried our best to reference all of the code that we have borrowed,
    and unless specified, all code was written by the 3 programmers listed above.

<!-- Diego here: I found this cool template for an HTML file and decided it would be a cool
addition to what we were already working on. The HTML is a free template and can be found

    <p>To whom this may concern. We are <b>Axolotl 3301</b> and we are looking to fill some vacancies after a team of our interns were detained by Russian authorities during operation Walking Fish. While we can not reveal the inner details of the mission, we can share that it was an on location attempt to gain intelligence. The team was unfortunately sent to the Gulag. The following challenges are intended to cull the general population of interested hackers and recruit a new team who will hopefully know better than to work remotely from the comfort of a Ukrainian restaurant with free wifi...<br>

    We aren't just some college kids with nothing better to do, or some club just coming up with a fun activity. We are a super serious group of hackers with BIG INTENTIONS to completely revolutionize the world.

    <p>Axolotl 3301 is who I would trust to take the world to the stars if I wasn't already working on it. They are unrivaled in their coding prowess, and they are some of the only people in the world who I wouldn't wanna mess with. </p><br>

    <p>Knowing a thing or two about computers, I know that Axolotl 3301 knows a lot of things about computers. A lot of things that most people don't know, and this makes them dangerous. I respectfully fear Axolotl 3301 and apart from Global Warming and getting rid of infectious diseases, they are one of my biggest priorities..............I don't know what they're planning, but all I know is that when that many hackers of that quality get together, it can be nothing but trouble.</p><br>

    <p>Honestly, I'm very jealous of Axototl 3301. They're a bigger threat than I am some times, and that says a lot. Props to them!</p>

    <hr style="width:200px" class="w3-opacity">

    <p>================================================================<br>
    <b>Challenge 1</b>
    <br>================================================================<br>

    As an introduction to this three part challenge saga, find the correct integer number to continue on this recruitment path. Bonus points for taking the hard route.<br>

    <br>[EASY]<br>
    Find the most frequently repeating number in this array

    array = [76, 93, 35, 13, 86, 39, 86, 9, 2, 47, 55, 12, 35, 78, 96, 70, 47,
             28, 8, 77, 91, 94, 49, 40, 34, 47, 55, 58, 36, 22, 29, 16, 14, 66,
             74, 59, 67, 34, 98, 23, 67, 14, 48, 13, 15, 0, 68, 79, 35, 35, 82,
             99, 49, 46, 35, 40, 0, 83, 37, 72, 81, 26, 76, 40, 65, 19, 79,
             88, 84, 0, 15, 72, 7, 21, 44, 15, 6, 22, 76, 69, 87, 63, 0, 27,
             31, 7, 3, 11, 62, 63, 22, 50, 26, 1, 17, 78, 19, 52, 6, 53]<br>

    <b>Notes:</b>
    size of the array is 100
    0 <= array[i] < 100
    array[i] is non-negative<br>

    <br>[HARD]<br>
    Given an array of heights, a graph can be developed such that each number in the array corresponds to a bar, each bar being 1 space apart. Below is a graph representing the given data.<br>
    <img src="challenge1.jpeg" alt="example graph of challenge1" class="w3-image" width="992" height="1108">
    Your mission is to find two lines, which form a container, such that the container contains the largest possible area.<br>

    <br>Input: heights = [9, 2, 1, 4, 8, 7]<br>
    Output: ???<br>

    <br>================================================================<br>
    <b>Challenge 2</b>
    <br>================================================================<br>

    You're now one step closer to forming part of the secret hacking group. Start getting your passport ready and schedule your covid vaccine appointment because pretty soon you'll be joining your new team at a top-secret location abroad. Use the output number from Challenge 1 to decode this message.<br>

    <br>string = <b>"5789,:;<=?2@BBD7FFGH&#60;KK?NNOPQETGVWXYYM[\^Q_abcdWffZhik^mnaopqrsguwwylz{|~"</b><br>

    -Let c be the output for Challenge 1<br>
    -Let i be the index of y<br>

    -Use this equation to solve this challenge: <b>y = x - (c % 2 + c / 5) - i</b><br>
    <img src="challenge2.jpeg" alt="Decoding graph for the 2nd challenge" class="w3-image" width="992" height="1108"><br>

     <br>================================================================<br>
        <b>Challenge 3</b>
      <br>================================================================<br>
      Almost done! The final step is to use the decoded message from challenge 2 as instructions for parsing the following string. Upon successful completion of this challenge, you will be eligible to start your journey as an elite hacker.<br>

      Parse the following string with the instructions from Challenge 2:<br>

      <br> string2 = <b>Q&#60;h]l@oJ&#60;q[]dHIrrh-%u%!Ld6--?h57^)Trd1{0dA()GG9@xnt 3C2I]X`ZqH9Odz{,_`_M5Grjh?kAk\dEQc!o[qB?nfq$Q`HlldWZq?\##AP>#<b><br>
